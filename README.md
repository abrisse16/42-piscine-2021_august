## The Piscine

The Piscine is the last step of the selection process to enter 42. It is a 4-week intensive coding bootcamp where you learn the basics of programming and the fundamentals of the C language. The Piscine is a full-time program, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. It is a very challenging experience, but also a very rewarding one where you learn a lot about yourself and your ability to learn. You discover the 42 pedagogy and you find out if it is a good fit for you.
